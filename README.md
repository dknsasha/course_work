Numerical solution of the problem 

The problem requires solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which can be only solved numerically. The eigenfunction is decomposed in Chebyshev polynomials, thus we reduce the spectral problem to the algebraic problem of finding eigenvalues. So, here is the code for finding the eigenvalues using GNU Scientific Library. Eigenvectors are written to the file and then the eigenfunction can be restored.
